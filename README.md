# Gordon. jQuery Style
**Gordon** is a plugin that manages the display of error messages using pure JavaScript. This is a branch geared towards jQuery users so the plugin is chainable and easy to use with jQuery.

Questions? Problems? Hit me up on Twitter ([@tubbo](http://twitter.com/tubbo).) or just [shoot me a message](http://github.com/inbox/new/tubbo).

## Features
* Three display formats ("notice", "alert" and "info"), all configurable using the bundled CSS file.
* Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for speedy animations, when available.

* * *

## Usage
To get started using Gordon, all you have to do is include `jquery.gordon.js` and `gordon.css` in your web application. Then, invoke it!

### $('#your-flash-element-id').flash('a flash message');
for simple, notice-based queries

#### **NOTE:** You can opt to just display the last set status message by invoking the `flash.` methods without any arguments.
